# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

In this project, we use React to create a responsive bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. The default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
